The approach that I took to write this program was to make the primes function more efficient.
This started with me making the ineffiecnt code where it loops through all number under the number and checks if it is divisible.
Then I looked through every second number as all the even numbers are checked if 2 is checked.
Then I noticed that the largest number of a multiple has to be less than the sqrt of that number so the code does not need to look through most of the number.


My code will run throguh 10^8 in under 15 seconds.
